# Rule Engine with AST

## Project Description

This project is focused on creating a **Rule Engine** that utilizes an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** to evaluate dynamic rules based on specified attributes such as age, department, salary, and experience. The application comprises an API built with **Node.js** and **Express**, which allows users to create rules, modify existing ones, and evaluate these rules against user data. The rules are stored in a **MongoDB** database, ensuring persistence and easy retrieval.

## Features

- Create new rules
- Evaluate existing rules against user data
- Modify existing rules
- Retrieve all stored rules
- Implemented input validation using **Zod**

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js
- **Cors**: Package to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- **Zod**: Type-safe schema declaration and validation library
- **.enc**: Reducing the need for manual configuration

## Setup Instructions

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tejas-pr/Rule-Engine-with-AST.git
```

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd Rule-Engine-with-AST
npm install
```

Create a .env and congig file in the root directory of your project and add your MongoDB connection string:

```bash
# config.js:
{
    "connectionString" : "MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING"
}

# .env
PORT = PORT_NUMBER
```

Start the server using Nodemon for development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will run on http://localhost:5000/${routes}
